# cav_workshop_source
Source code for the CAV workshop/challenge.

Here you can see the final code that you guys will be able to make by the end of the workshop. 
For the challenge you need to clone this repo, create a new branch and costomize the code with
your own road scenario, car configuration and any other changes you want to make! Once 
you are done go ahead and make a pull request so then everyone can see your code!
